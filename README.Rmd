# quickns

## Overview

quickns provides a useful function, `quick_ns()`, which generates a B-spline basis matrix for a natural cubic spline faster. The usage is totally the same as the basic `ns()` function in the base R `splines` package.

The R code of `quick_ns()` is adapted from `ns()`. Some heavy computation process in `ns()` originally written in R is rewritten in C++ for better efficiency. Ideally, `quick_ns()` could save about 50% time than `ns()` on large data.
